# atac - High Level Specification
This document presents a high level specification for what the SW interface should look like. It is language agnostic and is primarily used for brainstorming.

## Feature List
This section lists the high level features we expect the SW interface to support:

1. An abstraction for trees (nodes + edges)
2. An abstraction for risk models that can be overlayed on trees
3. A "context" abstraction that acts as an input channel for a tree (or subtree) to specify dynamic behavior.
